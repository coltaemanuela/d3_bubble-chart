# d3_bubble-chart
The visualisation is represented by a bubble chart. It illustrates more dimensions, as it follows:

The first dimension which decides the bubble position on the X axis is the “Projected/Actual Project Completion Date (B2)”. 

The second one decides the bubble position on the Y axis and consists of the “Projected/Actual Cost ($ M)” 

The size of the bubble is a number of the proposed projects by an agency over a particular year. This is a complex value and is calculated by using the agency code and counting the number of the proposed projects over each year. 
The color of the bubble depends on the “Agency Code” column.
